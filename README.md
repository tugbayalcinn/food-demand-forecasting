#  Food Demand Forecasting

This project tackles a real-world food demand forecasting problem, presented on the **Analytics Vidhya** platform. For food delivery businesses dealing with perishable inventory, accurately predicting daily and weekly demand is critical to avoid overstocking or running out of stock.

##  About the Project

Demand forecasting is a key component for any growing online business. Without accurate forecasting processes, it becomes nearly impossible to maintain the right level of inventory at the right time.

In this project:
- A real-world dataset is analyzed,
- Daily food demand trends are modeled,
- Regression-based forecasting models are developed.

**Objective**: Minimize waste caused by overproduction and prevent customer loss due to stockouts.

##  Project Workflow

- Exploratory Data Analysis and cleaning  
- Feature engineering for model preparation  
- Forecasting with regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)  
- Model evaluation (RMSE)  
- Interpretation of prediction results

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- XGBoost / LightGBM
